# StudyDoroApp
an app we made

This 20 minute break is for you to watch any show with 20 minute episodes or maybe just do something that is a reward to you within the 20 minutes. With this being a relatively new concept, there are little to no timers that work similar to ours. Now it is time to tour the app and show you all its features:
