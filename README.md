On the home tab, it shows reminders of  upcoming events that were tagged as the more important

On the goals tab, it shows the weekly goals and all goals you have created, as well as a button to add new goals

On the completed tab, it shows your weekly study stats.

The timer button in the bottom right launched a study session
You can set, pause, and reset a custom timer(the recommended length is 50-60 minutes) and once the time is up it takes you to an optional 20 minute break page

During the study session, you can check off the tasks you have completed

The calendar button on the home screen is utilized to plan a future study session and invite a friend
