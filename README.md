# StudyDoroApp
A study app to manages your work and time utilizing the Pomodoro study system.

How our timed study system works:

Our team decided to create an app based off of animeDoro by Josh Chen. This works similar to pomodoro which has a 25 minute study session and a 5 minute break, but StudyDoro instead takes the concepts of animeDoro and has a 50 minute study session and a 20 minute optional break. This 20-minute break is for the user to watch any show with 20-minute episodes or any rewarding activities. With this being a relatively new concept, there are little to no timers that work similar to ours.

App Features:
- Setting goals
- Accomplished goals
- Study Reminders
- Starting a study session
- Suggested break
- Google Calendar Integration
- Accomplishments

App Demo:

Our app consists of 3 tabs.

On the home tab, it shows reminders of  upcoming events that were tagged as the more important.

On the goals tab, it shows the weekly goals and all goals you have created, as well as a button to add new goals.

On the completed tab, it shows your weekly study stats.

The timer button in the bottom right launched a study session.
You can set, pause, and reset a custom timer(the recommended length is 50-60 minutes) and once the time is up it takes you to an optional 20 minute break page.
Once the 20-minute break is over, it goes back to the Study Session Timer.

During the study session, you can check off the tasks you have completed.

The calendar button on the home screen is utilized to plan a future study session and invite a friend(optional).

We planned to add more features, but didn't have time. If we had more time, this is what we would:
- Study reminder notifications
- Checking off goals
- Progress bar
- Accomplishments stats
- and more as good ideas always come during implementation! :)
